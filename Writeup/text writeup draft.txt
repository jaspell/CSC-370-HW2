Abstract

Functional regression is a widely-used technique for fitting known-type functions to data sets for the purposes of making accurate, generalizable projections. But what can we do if we do not know the type of function the data represents? Symbolic regression, using a genetic algorithm, is one way to answer this question. We apply evolutionary principles to this problem by treating a generated set of diverse functions as "parents," combining traits for a child set, and repeating over the course of several generations to produce a well-fitting function for three different sets of data.
